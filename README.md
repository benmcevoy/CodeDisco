# CodeDisco

ported/hacked from Phill's https://github.com/philldellow/Key-Code-Disco

is now a visual studio extension, if you build it should create a VISX in the bin which you can double click to install. alternatively you run it as an "experimental" plugin and visual studio will start up a new VS instance to try it out in.

i need to piss around with the loops and whatnot so it sounds better!
